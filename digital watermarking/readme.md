I have executed the code in Google colab.
The code provided can be opened with a Jupyter notebook. 
Run all the cells in the colab file.
Specifically, import the file in Colab and run it because some functions of libraries have been written according to colab’s environment only and may not run on local device.
Go to the last cell where the heading mentions “Run the program”.
Run the cells.
